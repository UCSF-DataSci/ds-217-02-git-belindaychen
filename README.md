# About Me 
I'm Belinda, a first year in the HDS Master's program. ðŸ™‚ I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Chemical Biology degree (+ public health and data science minors) in May 2024, and hope to pursue a PhD following the program. I've self-taught myself Git, leetcode, web scraping, etc so I'm looking forward to learning these topics in a formal setting. I am most interested in learning the ML topics to supplement my interest in medical image segmentation.

## Internet meme that I like 
There has been this baby Thai hippo named "Moo Deng" (translated to Chubby Pig) that's been going viral on the internet right now, and I hold so much affection for him
